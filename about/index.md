Hi there, I'm Stefan Flanderijn. At the moment, I'm in the final stage of my Master Sustainable Energy Technology at the University of Twente.

During this Master programme, I've done an internship at BTG-BTL in Enschede, where I worked on a dynamic model of several components of a pyrolysis production plant. I've started a project with the goal of simulating the behavior of a complete pyrolysis production plant. Several students and interns after me continued the work I've started.

For my final thesis, I'm working on a CFD-model of a pyrolysis reactor. Using ANSYS CFX the behavior of a cyclone reactor is studied. In this cyclone reactor torrefied biomass is converted into char, vapours and gases. The vapours and gases are separated from the char in this cyclone and then gasified in a second reactor at a higher temperature. The syngas produced in this process can be later upgraded to SNG which can be fed into the gas network.

When I'm not working on my thesis, I have plenty of other stuff to do. I like Linux and other open source software. For instance, I've configured and still maintain 2 servers  where around 20 websites and accompanying mail accounts are hosted. I prefer to use open source software as much as possible (so I run Arch Linux on my laptop, and Debian on my mail server).

E-sports is another hobby. This started with Starcraft 2, and currently I'm mostly interested in League of Legends. After playing mostly for fun, I've started following the pro-scene more over the years, and visited the League Championship Series in Berlin in 2015.

Oh, and if you want to check out some of the photographs I took, take a look at my [photo gallery](http://lucille.student.utwente.nl/wordpress "Photo gallery")
