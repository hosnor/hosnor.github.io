I think I've found a new favorite desktop environment. Gnome has got me hooked and now Gnome 3 is maturing it really inspires me to get stuff done. In this post I'll tell you why I like it.

As you might know (or not), I'm a fan of Linux and other open source software. Although I didn't remove my proprietary operating system (Windows), I did install Arch Linux on my laptop. Inspired by the lovely folks at reddit, and more so [/r/unixporn](http://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn), I switched from Ubuntu to Arch. I hear you thinking; only because it looks prettier? Maybe :) But let me tell you first shortly how I got to this point.

## In the beginning
there was a little boy who accidentally wiped the family computer trying to install some obscure Linux distribution. I must be around 13 years old or something and fortunately there wasn't too much data destroyed (oops). I ended up with reinstalling Windows eventually, but the seed was planted. In the following years, once I had figured out the whole dual-booting, I hopped from distro to distro and settled ultimately with Ubuntu (4.10 or 5.04 iirc).

Then I went to college and found that dual-booting Linux on my laptop was a bit too much of a hassle. Especially then, the support for games was actually pretty horrible. So besides a mailserver running Debian Testing, I refrained from using Linux, at least on my laptop/desktop pc.

### Get to the point already!
Yeah, I can almost hear you thinking: "Very nice and all, but get to the point!". The image I'm trying to paint is that I have long time experience with Linux, but not so much on the desktop. In my early days I hopped from distro to distro, trying out all sorts of Desktop Environment. I couldn't really stick to one for a real long time. From that point of view, Windows does a good job imho.

But when I bought my current laptop, a Dell Latitude E7440, I found out that it could be possible to place an extra SSD in the mini PCI-e slot, since that is the same connector as mSATA. So I ordered a 120GB mSATA drive and installed Ubuntu. But again, Unity wasn't really inspiring for me. It is stable, and has it strong suits but I wanted something nice and pretty. I wanted other people to say: "Wow, what is that you have on your pc?!" When I look at a Macbook running OSX, I get a similar feeling. The interface, the fonts, it all makes somewhat sense. So I tried [Elementary OS](http://elementary.io), which has a similar philosohy to some extent. Applications are looking polished and clean. But the progress of Elementary was too slow and some minor quirks and bugs prevented me from using it without any annoyance.

## Arch, yay!
Around this time I came across the subreddit [/r/unixporn](http://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn).
